Explain why we cannot use the following implementation for the method push
in our linked Stack.

	Error_code Stack :: push(Stack_entry item)
	{
		Node new_top(item, top_node);
		top_node = new_top;
		return success;
	}

My explanation: Because this implementation does not contain the keyword new or the aterisk sign
of the pointer, which would tell the compiler create this node on the heap. Therefore these cannot 
be dynamic objects.
