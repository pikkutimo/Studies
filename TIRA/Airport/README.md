# Airport simulator - Project assignment

Exercise pertaining to the use and modification of Queue and Extended_queue classes from 
the book "Data Structures and Program Design in C++" by Robert L. Kruse and Alexander J. Ryba.

The assignment is divided into stages with spesified goals that you must pass to gain points.

## One point

Create the basic simulator from the book without any modification. 

Aim for such traffic density that the airport runs at its peak capacity. Run the simulation and 
create text document of the results.

## Two points

Create version where there are separate runways for both landings and takeoffs. Compare the
