Compilation

    The program is compiled and linked through following command on linux machine or alternatively
    using the included make file. [Requirements are gcc compiler and gnu make.]

    g++ -std=c++11 -o main main.cpp functions.cpp stack.cpp utilities.cpp

    or

    make

Running the program

    ./main

    Running the program with the argument -p activates the prompt mode.

    ./main -p

Testing the program

    My testing consisted of basic calculations done by me and checking the given results by calculator.

    [SUM]: 1 1 + =>2 || 2 3 + => 5 || 134 1413 + => 1547

    [MINUS]: 90 - 13 => 77 || 13123 - 342 => 12781 || 1341341 - 1231341 => 110000

    [MULTIPLY]: 3 3 * => 9 || 27 3 * => 81 || 81 81 * => 6561

    [DIVISION]: 6561 81 / => 81 || 81 9 / => 9 || 9 9 / => 1

    [EXHANGE]: 1 2 x => 1 || 1 3 x => 1

    [EXPONENTIATION]: 12 2 ^ => 144 || 0 ^ => 1 || 100 10 ^ => 100,000,000,000,000,000,000

    [MODULO]: 999 3 % => 0 || 347 7 % => 4 || 7919 % 9 => 8

    [SQUAREROOT]: 9 v => 3 || 6561 v => 81 || 7919 v => 88.9888

Points I'm aiming for

    The only option is five points.

Hours

    Friday, October 9th - 3 hours - Reconstituting the sources from the book. Some complications relating
                                    to my systems reinstall.

    Monday, October 12th - 2 hours - Added all the functions needed to complete the books example.

    Wednesday, October 14th - 4 hours - Added the parts required for five points. Refactored the codebase
                                        and added some comments.

    Thursday, October 15th - ? hours - Improve the input for the prompt. Finish this document.

Desing decisions

    First my design was limited by the base program provided, but once I began working on the prompt
    version I refactored parts of the code. Mainly the modifications were related to parts of the program
    I could make into separate functions.
